# RubyLab
This project uses Ruby to create a simulation of rock, paper, scissor, lizard, spock. Uses multiple different classes for the various elements, player/bot types, as well as a class to keep track of the history of moves. This project was great practice in strengthening my understanding of OOP principles while learning a language I was previously unfamiliar in.
